# Marketing-Campaign-Effectiveness-Measurement

### Objective:

To find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.

The following project focus on the analysis of a dataset 'Bank Marketing' which contains data about customers and aims to get useful insights from the data and predict if a new customer will accept a deposit offer or not. Determine clusters among the sample population that will most likely open term deposit accounts.

### Dataset:
It comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository.



What is a Term Deposit?
A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institurion offers with a fixed rate (often better than just opening deposit account) in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time.


The project is structured as follows:

-  Data Cleaning + Feature Engineering
-  Exploratory Data Analysis
-  Data preparation for ML algorithms (encoding)
-  XGBOOST training and Hyperparameter optimization
-  Results Summary
